# 1. Array Subsets
# conditions, intersection A&B is null, union A&B is = to orginal, 
# subset A is minmal, sum of A > sum of B elements

# return subset in increaseing order where sum of A's > sum of B's
# if more than on subset, return one with maximal sum

# ex: n = 5, arr = [3,7,5,6,2]
# return: [6,7]
